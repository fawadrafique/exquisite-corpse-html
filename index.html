    <h1>Roosters of Harry</h1>
    <p>
        <i>Harry had two roosters, Both were smart <br>
            One of the rooster was named Piano, One was called a Guitar <br>
            One of the rooster had a black tail, One had a red <br>
            One of the rooster had a exotic beak, One had an amazing catwalk
        </i>
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>
            One of the rooster was gigantic, One was really small <br>
            One of the rooster had punk hair, One had beatle hair <br>
            One of the rooster had all the chicks, One had none
        </i>
    </p>

    <p>
    	<i>
		One of the roosters was strong, One was weak <br>
		One of the roosters was smart, one was beautiful<br>
		One of the rooosters was a coder, One was a baker
	</i>
	</p>

    <p>Each rooster had a <em>captivating</em> personality.</br>
    Harry loved both of them, but they didn't like each other so much. That's a pity because they could really learn a lot from one another...</p>
